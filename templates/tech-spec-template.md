## Summary

An abstract for the tech specification: the "who/what/when/where/why" of this feature space, made succinct.

## Background

For this section, answer these questions:
* Why do this?
* What's the motivation?
* What's the user problem this attempts to solve?
* What work has been done on this previously (if applicable)?

## Objective

A combination of goals and non-goals, objective should highlight all outcomes.

### Goals

This should drive information about positive intention, what this implementation is intending to accomplish. Answer the question "Did we achieve our goal with this work?". Consider a list of bullet points for these positive goals.

### Non-Goals

This section should be used to help reduce scope creep, by dictating something you are intentionally *not* doing or solving with this specific specification. Consider listing these in bullet points.

## Plan

Use this section to describe out how this feature will evolve from Product specifications into a viable feature. This should include:

* Feed references and connections
  * Either reference the APIs in this repository, or define expectations for one-off API requirements
* Visual documentation
* More technical specifications, or platform-specific details

This will most likely be the longest and most in-depth section of the spec.

## Debug/Testing

List any information and controls that would be useful to have in the Debug Menu.

## Measurements

Define what impacts this feature, what this feature impacts, and how to measure it.

## Security, Privacy, & Risks

Define how any part of this feature could potentially expose the app to risk.

## Other Considerations

Discuss approaches or understandings that were considered but were decided against. Use this section to document non-viable approaches to avoid churn.

## Milestones

Document milestone dates and use this as a single source of truth if these change.

## Open Questions

List unresolved design or implementation questions, along with an invitation for reviewers to give feedback.
